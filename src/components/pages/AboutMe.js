                <p className="aboutMe">
                    I graduated from Tulane University in May 2022 with a degree in Psychology and Social Innovation & Social Entrepreneurship. Along with this, I have a Full-Stack Web Development Certification from the University of Pennsylvania where I learned how to design, develop, and launch web applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Bulma, Node.JS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, React, GraphQL, Jest, and Git. I love problem solving, designing systems, and creating applications from scratch. In addition, I am extremely interested in the intersection of ethics and technology in regards to data, people, and processes. I strive for a world in which technology and code is ethical, just, and unbiased.
